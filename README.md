# Birdsong Recognition Quizz Game

This is a multiplayer game where people try to identify a bird by it's song, using [BirdnetLite](https://github.com/kahst/BirdNET-Lite) as an engine.

##Â Principle

Players get one bird song identified with a picture of the bird and the specie name, then get three other songs without any label.
Players must vote for the song they think is of the same specie as the labelled one.
If they win, they win a few points and the ones with the most points get to be on a podium.

Players connect to a server, using one of two ways:
 - If they are "local", they are considered to be together around one big screen and a few speakers, and use their device (for instance a smartphone) to give their answer.
 - If they are "distant", they get the bird songs on their personal player.
